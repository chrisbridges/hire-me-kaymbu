      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>Quick Learner</h4>
        <p>Chris is a very quick learner, partially due to his talent for programming, and partially thanks to his passion for software. Chris was my mentee at Thinkful Inc., during this time I learned as much from him as what I can offer him. Chris is always energetic and eager to experiment. He has not only become an expert in React and front-end, but he has written complex backends leveraging Express and MongoDB. Be it front end, back end, or testing - I would count on Chris as the professional to carry it forward.</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>Integrity</h4>
        <p>I had the pleasure of hiring and working with Christopher as one of the tutors for our Math Learning Center. He is reliable, hard-working, and of high integrity. I would HIGHLY recommend Christopher for any post or position for which he may apply; he would be an asset to any organization with which he is involved!</p>
        <p>- Tom Shirey (Professor of Mathematics, Vanguard University)</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>Outstanding</h4>
        <p>Chris Bridges was an outstanding Campus Ambassador for InstaEDU during his time with us. He not only was self-motivated and hard-working, but also very personable and could sell a concept or a pitch to anyone he communicated with. His outstanding work showed in his results. I'd recommend Chris to anyone who is looking to work with someone who is an expert salesman, punctual, creative, self-motivated, and gives his 100% to any endeavor he embarks on.</p>
        <p>- Alberto Aroeste (Lead Project Manager at Chegg)</p>
